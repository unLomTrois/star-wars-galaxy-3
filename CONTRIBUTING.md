- editing the galaxy by adding or changing systems and hyperlanes
- creating planet textures or planetary environments
- creating deposits and modifiers for planets
- helping by providing lore info

and even more.

Please remember to only use your own code for anything you want to contribute to this project.

# Contributing code

Let's say you want to add the system_initializer for your favourite system: Juvex.

1. Go over to [the list of issues](https://gitlab.com/renegades-modding-group/star-wars-galaxy-2/-/issues) and make sure that the juvex system is not already worked on or even finished for the next version
2. If not the case create an issue so everyone knows you are creating the initializer
3. Fork the repo and create your branch from master or the upcoming version.
4. Add the Juvex system in all its glory!
5. Issue your merge request into the upcoming version branch and wait for it to be approved
6. Thank you so much for contributing to Star Wars Galaxy 2 and when approved enjoy the Juvex system in the next update!
